# iOS Star Wars API Client

A (somewhat) generic REST API client for iOS for fetching and displaying data, developed as part of a coding challenge.

# Requirements

- Xcode supporting iOS 17.2 or higher, Xcode 15.3 recommended

# Setup

This project can be run directly from the Xcode project file. There are no third-party dependencies.

# Further Development

See [Issues](https://github.com/easytarget2000/ios-starwars-api-client/issues) for a list of 
potential features and improvements.

# Contribution

This is an open-source project intended as a learning exercise and coding challenge demonstration.
I welcome contributions to enhance the app and improve the codebase, especially software design aspects,
such as code improvements. Please note that this is primarily a showcase project.
While I'm open to contributions, I might prioritise code clarity and simplicity over adding extensive new features.
